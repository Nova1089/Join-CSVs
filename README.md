# Join-CSVs
- Join 2 or more CSV files based on related columns between them.
  - Specified columns don't have to have the same name, but should have some matching records.
  - Same concept as a SQL table join. See: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp
  - Note that the names of each CSV will be added to the column headers.
